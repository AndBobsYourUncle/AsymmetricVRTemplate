# AsymmetricVRTemplate

Developed with Unreal Engine 5

This is simply the default VR template from Unreal, set up with a migrated third person character from the default thrid person Unreal template.

It is set up so that the VR player runs as the server, and the third person character runs as the client. All VR controller input then needs to be replicated, and other various actors in game need replication enabled.
